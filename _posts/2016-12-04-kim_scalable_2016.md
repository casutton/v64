title: Scalable Structure Discovery in Regression using Gaussian Processes
abstract: Automatic Bayesian Covariance Discovery (ABCD) in Lloyd et. al (2014) provides
  a framework for automating statistical modelling as well as exploratory data analysis
  for regression problems. However ABCD does not scale due to its $O(N^3)$ running time.
  This is undesirable not only because the average size of data sets is growing fast,
  but also because there is potentially more information in bigger data, implying
  a greater need for more expressive models that can discover sophisticated structure.
  We propose a scalable version of ABCD, to encompass big data within the boundaries
  of automated statistical modelling.
