title: Towards Automatically-Tuned Neural Networks
abstract: Recent advances in AutoML have led to automated tools that can compete with
  machine learning experts on supervised learning tasks. However, current AutoML tools
  do not yet support modern neural networks effectively. In this work, we present
  a first version of Auto-Net, which provides automatically-tuned feed-forward neural
  networks without any human intervention. We report results on datasets from the
  recent AutoML challenge showing that ensembling Auto-Net with Auto-sklearn often
  performs better than either alone, and report the first results on winning a competition
  dataset against human experts with automatically-tuned neural networks.
