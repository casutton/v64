title: Parameter-Free Convex Learning through Coin Betting
abstract: We present a new parameter-free algorithm for online linear optimization
  over any Hilbert space. It is theoretically optimal, with regret guarantees as good
  as with the best possible learning rate. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement.
  The analysis is given via the adversarial coin-betting game, Kelly betting and the
  Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator. Applications to obtain parameter-free convex optimization
  and machine learning algorithms are shown.
