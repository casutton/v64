title: Adapting Multicomponent Predictive Systems using Hybrid Adaptation Strategies
  with Auto-WEKA in Process Industry
abstract: Automation of composition and optimisation of multicomponent predictive
  systems (MCPSs) made of a number of preprocessing steps and predictive models is
  a challenging problem that has been addressed in recent works. However, one of the
  current challenges is how to adapt these systems in dynamic environments where data
  is changing over time. In this work we propose a hybrid approach combining different
  adaptation strategies with the Bayesian optimisation techniques for parametric,
  structural and hyperparameter optimisation of entire MCPSs. Experiments comparing
  different adaptation strategies have been performed on 7 datasets from real chemical
  production processes. Experimental analysis shows that optimisation of entire MCPSs
  as a method of adaptation to changing environments is feasible and that hybrid strategies
  perform better in most of the analysed cases.
