title: 'TPOT: A Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool for Automating Machine Learning'
abstract: As data science becomes more mainstream, there will be an ever-growing demand
  for data science tools that are more accessible, flexible, and scalable. In response
  to this demand, automated machine learning (autoML) researchers have begun building
  systems that automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines.
  In this paper we present TPOT, an open source genetic programming-based autoML system
  that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with
  the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification task.
  We benchmark TPOT on a series of 150 supervised classification tasks and find that
  it significantly outperforms a basic machine learning analysis in 22 of them, while
  experiencing minimal degradation in accuracy on 5 of the benchmarksâ€”all without
  any domain knowledge nor human input. As such, GP-based autoML systems show considerable
  promise in the autoML domain.
