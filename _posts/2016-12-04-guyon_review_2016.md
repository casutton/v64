title: 'A Brief Review of the ChaLearn AutoML Challenge: Any-time Any-dataset Learning
  without Human Intervention'
abstract: The ChaLearn AutoML Challenge team conducted a large scale evaluation of
  fully automatic, black-box learning machines for feature-based classification and
  regression problems. The test bed was composed of 30 data sets from a wide variety
  of application domains and ranging across different types of complexity. Over five
  rounds, participants succeeded in delivering AutoML software capable of being trained
  and tested without human intervention. Although improvements can still be made to
  close the gap between human-tweaked and AutoML models, this challenge has been a
  leap forward in the field and its platform will remain available for post-challenge
  submissions at http://codalab.org/AutoML.
