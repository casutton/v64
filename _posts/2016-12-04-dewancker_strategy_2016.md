title: A Strategy for Ranking Optimization Methods using Multiple Criteria
abstract: Many methods for optimizing black-box functions exist, and many metrics
  exist for judging the performance of a specific optimization method. There is not,
  however, a generally agreed upon strategy for simultaneously comparing the performance
  of multiple optimization methods for multiple performance metrics across a range
  of optimization problems. This paper proposes such a methodology, which uses nonparametric
  statistical tests to convert the metrics recorded for each problem into a partial
  ranking of optimization methods; these partial rankings are then amalgamated through
  a voting mechanism to generate a final score for each optimization method. Mathematical
  analysis is provided to motivate decisions within this strategy, and numerical results
  are provided to demonstrate the potential insights afforded thereby.
